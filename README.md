# NVIDIA GPU Temperature Monitor

A system service that monitors NVIDIA GPU temperature and can perform emergency shutdowns if temperatures reach critical levels. It also sends notifications via Gotify when temperatures are high.

## Features

- Monitors NVIDIA GPU temperature in real-time
- Sends notifications via Gotify when temperatures exceed thresholds
- Can perform emergency system shutdown if temperature remains critical
- Works on both Linux and Windows
- Systemd service integration on Linux
- Windows Event Log integration on Windows

## Prerequisites

### System Dependencies

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsystemd-dev pkg-config
```

#### Linux (Fedora/RHEL)
```bash
sudo dnf install systemd-devel
```

### Python Dependencies
All Python dependencies are handled automatically during installation. The main ones are:
- `requests` - For sending notifications
- `python-dotenv` - For configuration management
- `systemd-python` (Linux) - For systemd integration
- `pywin32` (Windows) - For Windows Event Log integration

## Installation

### Linux Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd nvidia_gpu_temperature_monitor
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

3. Install the service:
```bash
make install
```

The installation will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all required dependencies
- Copy the necessary files to `/usr/local/lib/gpu-monitor`
- Set up the systemd service

> **Note**: The python script functionality has been tested, but the installation process has not been tested on Linux systems. Windows script, installation paths and service integration are currently untested.

### Windows Installation

#### Method 1: Using the Installer (Recommended)

1. Download and install WiX Toolset:
   - Go to https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases/latest
   - Download the latest WiX Toolset (e.g., `wix311.exe`)
   - Run the installer
   - Add WiX bin directory to your system PATH:
     1. Open System Properties (Win + R, type `sysdm.cpl`)
     2. Go to Advanced tab â†’ Environment Variables
     3. Under System Variables, find and edit "Path"
     4. Add the WiX bin directory (typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.11\bin`)
     5. Click OK to save

2. Build the installer:
```powershell
# From the project root
cd scripts
.\build_installer.ps1
```

3. Run the generated installer (`gpu-temp-monitor-setup.msi`)

The installer will:
- Check for Python and prompt to install if missing
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Install mock nvidia-smi if needed
- Set up and start the Windows service
- Create start menu shortcuts

The MSI installer provides several advantages:
- Standard Windows installation experience
- Proper upgrade/uninstall handling
- Group Policy deployment support
- Silent installation support (`msiexec /i gpu-temp-monitor-setup.msi /quiet`)

#### Method 2: Development Setup

For development or testing, you can use the PowerShell script:

```powershell
# From the project root
cd scripts
.\setup_windows.ps1
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Gotify server configuration
GOTIFY_SERVER_URL=https://your-gotify-server
GOTIFY_TOKEN=your-gotify-token

# Temperature thresholds (in Celsius)
HIGH_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD=80
CRITICAL_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD=90

# Monitoring settings
CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60
EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN_DURATION_SECONDS=300
```

## Service Management

### Linux
```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl start gpu-monitor

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop gpu-monitor

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status gpu-monitor

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u gpu-monitor -f
```

### Windows
> **Note**: Windows service integration is currently untested. The following commands are provided as a reference based on standard Windows service management practices.

The service is managed through the Windows Services application or using PowerShell:
```powershell
# Start the service
Start-Service -Name "GPU Monitor"

# Stop the service
Stop-Service -Name "GPU Monitor"

# Check service status
Get-Service -Name "GPU Monitor"
```

## Development

### Linux Development
You can run the monitor directly from the source directory:
```bash
python srcs/gpu_monitor.py
```

### Windows Development
To develop and run the monitor on Windows:

1. Create a virtual environment:
```powershell
# Create a virtual environment named .venv
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```powershell
# In PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Or in Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3. Install dependencies:
```powershell
# After activation, install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script:
```powershell
# The virtual environment's Python will be used
python srcs/gpu_monitor.py
```

### Cleaning Up
To clean the virtual environment:
```bash
make clean
```

## How It Works

1. The service runs as root to have necessary permissions for system shutdown
2. It checks GPU temperature at regular intervals (default: 60 seconds)
3. If temperature exceeds the high threshold:
   - Sends a notification via Gotify
   - Logs a warning
4. If temperature exceeds the critical threshold:
   - Starts a countdown (default: 300 seconds)
   - If temperature remains critical after the countdown:
     - Sends an emergency notification
     - Initiates system shutdown
5. The service automatically restarts if it crashes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service fails to start**
   - Check if NVIDIA drivers are properly installed
   - Verify that `nvidia-smi` works from the command line
   - Check system logs: `sudo journalctl -u gpu-monitor`

2. **Notifications not working**
   - Verify Gotify server URL and token in `.env`
   - Check network connectivity to Gotify server

3. **Permission issues**
   - Ensure the service is running as root
   - Check file permissions in `/usr/local/lib/gpu-monitor`
